DeveloperCompanion (devcomp)
============================

| DeveloperCompanion is a **100% open and hackable dev system** that can be used for collaborative realtime distributed system development

[DeveloperCompanion](devcomp) is [my](http://christophdorn.com) first *constantly improving* **reference implementation** for the application of the [PINF.Genesis](http://genesis.pinf.org) patterns to:

  * **Web Software Systems** and
  * **Web Software Development Workspaces**


Overview
--------

In the [Semantic Web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) context, [PINF](http://pinf.org) is a **Virtual Holographic Nodal Platform** in that it can erects virtual systems with API surfaces for *every URI it encounters* and allows the mounting of other URIs and the systems based on these URIs within arbitrary points of a host system.

PINF.Genesis focuses on applying the PINF patterns to the *Software Development Lifecycle* by implementing minimal core patterns that may be applied to all aspects of the SDL through multiple component implementations that interoperate.

DeveloperCompanion completes the picture by implementing **ONE** toolset based on PINF.Genesis. What is most important is that:

  * DeveloperCompanion **IS BUILT** using PINF.Genesis
  * DeveloperCompanion is being used to **FURTHER DEVELOP** PINF.Genesis
  * DeveloperCompanion is as virtual and phyical as it needs to be and can thus act as a template for any system

Thus DeveloperCompanion is qualified to make suggestions to improve the *Software Development Lifecycle* for itself and ultimately the ecosystem it supports.

The diagram below illustrates the *core of DeveloperCompanion* by showing the

  * Boot sequence originally initiated by Human User
  * Data and interaction spaces managed by system
  * **System-wide Event Loop** capturing **ALL** modifications to system
